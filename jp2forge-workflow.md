# JP2Forge Workflow Documentation

> **Note**: This documentation has been consolidated. Please refer to the following resources in the `docs` directory:

## Comprehensive Workflow Documentation

For complete workflow documentation, please see:

- [Workflow Overview](/docs/workflows.md) - Consolidated description of all workflows
- [Workflow Diagrams](/docs/workflow_diagram.md) - Visual diagrams of workflow processes
- [Architecture Documentation](/docs/architecture.md) - Detailed technical architecture

## Workflow Documentation Structure

The workflow documentation is now organized as follows:

1. **Workflow Overview** - High-level description and component relationships
2. **Workflow Diagrams** - Visual representations of processing flows
3. **Architecture Documentation** - Technical details of implementation

This reorganization reduces redundancy and ensures all workflow information is maintained in a single, authoritative location.
