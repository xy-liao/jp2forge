JP2Forge - JPEG2000 Processing Package

This package provides a modular, extensible framework for processing JPEG2000 images,
including conversion, analysis, and metadata handling with BnF compliance support.

This is an independent implementation that relies on either Pillow or Kakadu (if available)
for actual JPEG2000 encoding/decoding operations.
