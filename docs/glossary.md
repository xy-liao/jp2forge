This glossary provides definitions for technical terms used throughout the JP2Forge documentation.

## JPEG2000 Terminology

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **JP2** | The file format for JPEG2000 images, with extension `.jp2` |
| **Codestream** | The compressed image data within a JP2 file |
| **Tile** | A rectangular region of the image that is independently encoded |
| **Component** | A color channel (e.g., R, G, B) in the image |
| **Resolution level** | A specific scale at which the image can be decoded |
| **Precinct** | A spatial region of the codestream used for organizing packets |
| **Code-block** | The fundamental unit for entropy coding |
| **Progression order** | The order in which compressed data is organized (LRCP, RLCP, RPCL, PCRL, CPRL) |
| **UUID Box** | Container for storing metadata within the JP2 file format |

## BnF Compliance Terminology

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **BnF** | Biblioth√®que nationale de France - French National Library |
| **BnF compliance** | Adherence to BnF technical specifications for digital preservation |
| **Compression ratio** | Ratio between original and compressed file sizes |
| **Compression ratio tolerance** | Acceptable deviation from target compression ratio |
| **Referential** | BnF's reference document defining technical requirements |

## Image Quality Metrics

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **PSNR** | Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio - Measures image quality (higher is better) |
| **SSIM** | Structural Similarity Index - Measures perceived quality (higher is better) |
| **MSE** | Mean Square Error - Average of squared differences between original and compressed pixels |

## Processing Terminology

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Chunking** | Processing large images in smaller pieces to manage memory usage |
| **Streaming processor** | Component that processes images in a memory-efficient way |
| **Memory mapping** | Technique for accessing files without loading them entirely into memory |
| **Adaptive worker pool** | System that adjusts the number of worker threads based on system resources |
| **Memory-efficient processing** | Techniques to minimize memory usage during image processing |
