## Bug Fixing Priority Guidelines

Bug fixes will be prioritized based on these criteria:

- **Critical** (P0): Security vulnerabilities, data loss issues, crashes affecting most users
  - Target resolution: Within 1 week
  - Immediate hotfix release

- **High** (P1): Functionality breakage, incorrect results, issues affecting many users
  - Target resolution: Within 2-4 weeks
  - Included in next minor release

- **Medium** (P2): Non-critical functionality issues, workarounds available
  - Target resolution: Within 1-2 months
  - Scheduled for appropriate release

- **Low** (P3): Minor issues, cosmetic problems, rare edge cases
  - Target resolution: No fixed timeline
  - Addressed as resources permit

## Feature Request Prioritization

New feature requests will be evaluated based on:

1. Alignment with project goals and BnF compliance requirements
2. User demand (number of requests, use case importance)
3. Implementation complexity and maintenance burden
4. Integration with existing functionality
5. Available development resources

## Resource Allocation Guidelines

Development resources will be allocated according to these guidelines:

- 50% - New feature development according to roadmap
- 25% - Bug fixing and issue resolution
- 15% - Technical debt reduction and refactoring
- 10% - Documentation and community support

## Release Schedule

The project follows this release schedule:

- **Major releases** (x.0.0): Once per year
  - Significant new features
  - Possible breaking changes (with migration guide)
  - Full documentation update

- **Minor releases** (x.y.0): Quarterly
  - New features
  - Non-breaking enhancements
  - Bug fixes

- **Patch releases** (x.y.z): As needed
  - Bug fixes
  - Security updates
  - No new features

## Implementation Notes

### Development Environment

- Standard development environment: Python 3.9+, pytest, black, flake8
- CI system: GitHub Actions
- Documentation: Markdown in repository, generated API docs

### Branching Strategy

- `main`: Latest stable release
- `develop`: Integration branch for next release
- `feature/*`: Feature branches
- `bugfix/*`: Bug fix branches
- `release/*`: Release preparation branches

### Tracking Progress

Progress will be tracked using GitHub Issues and Projects:

- Each task will be created as an issue
- Issues will be organized into milestones
- Project boards will visualize current work
- Regular status updates documented in milestone comments
