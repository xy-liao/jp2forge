# JP2Forge 0.9.1 Release Notes

Release Date: April 25, 2025

## Overview

JP2Forge 0.9.1 is a feature update that adds support for multi-page TIFF processing and improves directory structure naming consistency.

> **Note:** JP2Forge supports BnF-compliant processing without requiring Kakadu, implementing all essential BnF parameters through our built-in Pillow integration. While Kakadu would provide more complete support for all BnF robustness markers (SOP, EPH, PLT), the default implementation adheres to core BnF standards using Pillow's parameters.

## Changes in this Release

### Added
- Full support for multi-page TIFF processing with individual page extraction
- Options for handling existing files during multi-page TIFF conversion (skip_existing, overwrite)
- Automatic metadata tagging with page numbers for multi-page documents
- Memory-efficient chunking optimized for large multi-page TIFFs
- New example script demonstrating various multi-page TIFF processing options

### Changed
- Renamed directory paths from "images/" to "input_dir/" and "output_dir/" to "output_dir/" for better alignment with documentation examples
- Updated cleanup script to handle both old and new directory structures for backward compatibility
- Enhanced documentation with multi-page TIFF processing guide

## Installation

pip install jp2forge==0.9.1
