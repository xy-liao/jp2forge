# JP2Forge Implementation Roadmap

## Current Status (May 2025)

JP2Forge is currently at version 0.9.6 and provides a functional solution for converting images to JPEG2000 format with specialized support for BnF compliance. The core functionality is operational, but several enhancements are planned to improve robustness, maintainability, and full BnF compliance.

## Identified Improvement Areas

Based on our comprehensive technical analysis, we've identified the following areas that will be addressed in upcoming releases:

### BnF Compliance Enhancements

1. **BnF Validation Integration**
   - Status: ⚠️ Method exists but not automatically integrated
   - Plan: Integrate into standard workflow for automatic validation
   - Target Version: 1.0.0
   
2. **BnF UUID Collision Detection**
   - Status: ❌ Currently missing
   - Plan: Implement detection system for preventing UUID conflicts
   - Target Version: 1.0.0
   
3. **Complete BnF Compression Testing**
   - Status: ⚠️ Partially implemented
   - Plan: Fully implement BnF methodology from section 2.2 of specifications
   - Target Version: 1.1.0

### Architecture Improvements

1. **Metadata Handler Factory**
   - Status: ❌ Currently missing
   - Plan: Implement factory pattern to streamline metadata handling
   - Target Version: 1.1.0
   
2. **BnF Compliance Validator Class**
   - Status: ❌ Only methods exist
   - Plan: Create dedicated class for comprehensive validation
   - Target Version: 1.1.0
   
3. **Centralized BnF Module**
   - Status: ❌ Currently missing
   - Plan: Create unified `utils/bnf` module
   - Target Version: 1.1.0

### Quality Assurance

1. **Unit Test Infrastructure**
   - Status: ❌ Currently missing
   - Plan: Implement comprehensive test suite with pytest
   - Target Version: 1.0.0
   
2. **Edge Case Testing**
   - Status: ❌ Currently missing
   - Plan: Add specific tests for BnF edge cases
   - Target Version: 1.1.0
   
3. **Kakadu Integration Tests**
   - Status: ❌ Currently missing
   - Plan: Comprehensive testing of Kakadu integration
   - Target Version: 1.2.0

### Documentation

1. **BnF Implementation Details**
   - Status: ⚠️ Limited documentation
   - Plan: Create comprehensive technical documentation
   - Target Version: 1.0.0
   
2. **API Documentation**
   - Status: ⚠️ Limited to docstrings
   - Plan: Create full API reference documentation
   - Target Version: 1.1.0
   
3. **Architecture Decision Records**
   - Status: ❌ Currently missing
   - Plan: Document key architectural decisions
   - Target Version: 1.2.0

## Release Schedule

- Performance Optimization

## Current Workarounds

While we work on implementing these improvements, users can employ the following workarounds:

1. **BnF Validation**: Manually run the `validate_bnf_compliance()` method after conversion
2. **UUID Collision**: Manually check for UUID collisions using ExifTool
3. **Compression Testing**: Use the current `_check_compression_ratio()` method with additional manual verification

## Feedback and Contributions

We welcome user feedback and contributions to help prioritize and implement these improvements. Please submit issues or pull requests through our GitHub repository.
