- [ ] Functions use return values rather than modifying parameters
- [ ] Complex logic is broken down into helper functions

### 3.4 Type Hints

- [ ] Functions and methods have appropriate type hints

- [ ] Union types are used for multiple possible types

## 4. Error Handling

### 4.1 Exception Handling

- [ ] Appropriate exceptions are used for different error conditions
- [ ] Custom exceptions extend from appropriate base classes
- [ ] Exceptions include meaningful error messages
- [ ] Exceptions are documented in function docstrings
- [ ] Exception handling doesn't suppress important errors

### 4.2 Input Validation

- [ ] All function inputs are validated
- [ ] Edge cases are handled (empty containers, None values, etc.)
- [ ] File paths are validated before use
- [ ] Configuration values are validated
- [ ] External tool inputs are sanitized

### 4.3 Resource Management

- [ ] Files are properly closed (preferably using context managers)
- [ ] Temporary resources are cleaned up, even in error cases
- [ ] Resource leaks are prevented (file handles, memory, etc.)
- [ ] Timeouts are implemented for external operations
- [ ] System resource usage is monitored

## 5. Performance

### 5.1 Efficiency

- [ ] Algorithms have appropriate time complexity
- [ ] Memory usage is reasonable
- [ ] Large data structures are processed efficiently
- [ ] Unnecessary operations are avoided
- [ ] CPU-intensive operations are optimized

### 5.2 Concurrency

- [ ] Thread safety is ensured where needed
- [ ] Race conditions are prevented
- [ ] Resources are properly synchronized
- [ ] Deadlocks are prevented
- [ ] Parallel processing scales appropriately

### 5.3 I/O Operations

- [ ] I/O operations are minimized
- [ ] Buffering is used appropriately
- [ ] File operations use efficient modes
- [ ] Batch operations are used where appropriate
- [ ] Network operations handle timeouts and retries

## 6. Security

### 6.1 Input Handling

- [ ] User inputs are validated and sanitized
- [ ] Path traversal attacks are prevented
- [ ] Shell injection is prevented in subprocess calls
- [ ] XML external entity attacks are prevented
- [ ] File type validation is performed

### 6.2 External Tools

- [ ] Command-line arguments are properly escaped
- [ ] Tool outputs are validated
- [ ] Tool execution is controlled
- [ ] Error states are handled gracefully
- [ ] Tool paths are validated

### 6.3 Resource Protection

- [ ] Resource consumption is limited
- [ ] Denial of service prevention is implemented
- [ ] Sensitive information is not exposed in logs or errors
- [ ] Temporary files are created securely
- [ ] File permissions are set appropriately

## 7. Documentation

### 7.1 Code Documentation

- [ ] All modules have docstrings explaining their purpose
- [ ] All public classes and functions have docstrings

## Checklist Usage Guide

### When to Use

- **New Features**: Complete the checklist before submitting a pull request
- **Refactoring**: Focus on Architecture, Code Structure, and Maintenance
- **Bug Fixes**: Focus on Functionality, Error Handling, and Testing
- **Code Reviews**: Use as a reference when reviewing changes

### Priority Levels

Not all checklist items have equal importance. Consider the following priority levels:

- **Critical**: Must be addressed before code is merged
- **Important**: Should be addressed unless there's a good reason not to
- **Desirable**: Improve code quality but can be addressed in follow-up tasks

### Checklist Customization

This checklist can be customized for specific components:

- **Core Components**: Focus on Functionality, Performance, and Error Handling
- **Utility Components**: Focus on API Design, Reusability, and Documentation
- **CLI Components**: Focus on User Interface, Error Handling, and Documentation

## Implementation Tracking

For tracking purposes, issues may be linked to checklist items:

- Critical issue: #issue-number (critical)
- Important issue: #issue-number (important)
- Desirable improvement: #issue-number (desirable)
